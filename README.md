# iOS Portfolio
2020-2021 Portfolio

Hi, my name is Rishi Natraj, and this is a portfolio of apps and projects I've made throughout the years. My first exposure to code was in 9th grade, in the class AP Computer Science Principles, in which I made apps using MIT App Inventor. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned Java. I am currently taking iOS App development in which I am learning Swift. So far this year, I have made 1 working app, and am currently working on another app with some classmates. I have so far learned basic syntax for Swift, and have experimented a bit in many different areas, including animations, SpriteKit, and storyboards.

## Apps and Projects
###[Volcanic Panic][https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-idk-name]
This was a game i created last year with classmates. In the process of making this game, I learned a lot of utilizing JFrames and JPanels. I also incorporated a timer into this game to track score. KeyListeners and ActionListeners were used to allow the arrowkeys be used to move the character and to refresh the scene of the game 60 times a second.
