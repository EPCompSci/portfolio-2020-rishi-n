# iOS Portfolio
2020-2021 Portfolio

Hi, my name is Rishi Natraj, and this is a portfolio of apps and projects I've made throughout the years. My first exposure to code was in 9th grade, in the class AP Computer Science Principles, in which I made apps using MIT App Inventor. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned Java. I am currently taking iOS App development in which I am learning Swift. So far this year, I have made 1 working app, and am currently working on another app with some classmates. I have so far learned basic syntax for Swift, and have experimented a bit in many different areas, including animations, SpriteKit, and storyboards.
