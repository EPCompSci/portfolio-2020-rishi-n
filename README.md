# iOS Portfolio
2020-2021 Portfolio

Hi, my name is Rishi Natraj, and this is a portfolio of apps and projects I've made throughout the years. My first exposure to code was in 9th grade, in the class AP Computer Science Principles, in which I made apps using MIT App Inventor. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned Java. I am currently taking iOS App development in which I am learning Swift. So far this year, I have made 1 working app, and am currently working on another app with some classmates. I have so far learned basic syntax for Swift, and have experimented a bit in many different areas, including animations, SpriteKit, and storyboards.

## Apps and Projects
### [Volcanic Panic](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-idk-name)
This was a game i created last year with classmates. In the process of making this game, I learned a lot of utilizing JFrames and JPanels. I also incorporated a timer into this game to track score. KeyListeners and ActionListeners were used to allow the arrowkeys be used to move the character and to refresh the scene of the game 60 times a second. 

### [Calculator](https://github.com/rishi-n/calculator)
This is my first XCode app. I made it with many buttons all organized in mazy VStacks, HStacks, and ZStacks. Since this was my first app, I did not have the knowledge to implement a way for it to the operations in the correct order, and only knew how to make it do the operations in the order they were entered. Since then, I have learned much more, and if I ever get back to improving this app, I will implement order of operations into it.

### [Infection Tag](https://github.com/sarthyparty/Infection-Tag)
This is the game I am currently working on. As of the day when I am writing this, we just finished making a working Wall class for interaction with the player. Our next steps are to create the game logic, such as the infection mechanic, and possibly powerups, and make it an online game and add functionality to play with other people. As of now, we have created a moving character with animations, a base map for the game, and a Wall class.
